# Chaos in the Double Pendulum  
**Theoretical Physics Group Project** – January 31, 2023  
This repository contains our report and presentations.  

## University of Glasgow – Group Project (PHYS4029P)  
### Co-developed by:  
- **Bartosz Sobula** (2557113s)  
- **Nathan Weir** (2565037w)  

## Overview  
This project explores the behavior of both the **simple** and **double pendulum** using mathematical models and numerical simulations. We employ the **Runge-Kutta 4 (RK4) method** to analyze the dynamics under various conditions.  

### Objectives  
- Investigate the factors influencing pendulum motion.  
- Demonstrate how these factors can be controlled in a **simple pendulum**.  
- Highlight the **chaotic behavior** of the **double pendulum**, showing how small differences in initial conditions lead to vastly different outcomes over time.  

## Contents  
- **Report** – Detailed analysis of our findings.  
- **Presentations** – Slides summarizing key insights.  
- **Code & Simulations** – RK4 implementations for modeling pendulum motion.
